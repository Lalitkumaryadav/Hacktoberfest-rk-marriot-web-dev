Contributing to open source does not mean you must know how to write code. Code is only one part of open source. There are many things an open-source project might need. Below are just a few off the top of my mind:

Adding/Fixing Code: This is the obvious thing one might think about contributing to open-source projects. You can send in bug fixes, new features, or even fix a security issue. Send in a pull request for a feature that you have always wanted!
Improving Documentation: Documentation is essential for every project. Developers read it, and users need it. You can help improve/fix the documentation.
Helping in Translation: Being open source means anyone around the globe can access your project. But that also means that there will be people who do not be able to write/read/speak English.
Translation made available in their native language will boost collaboration.
Creating Graphics: Some software projects do not have anyone who can create graphics like a good Logo. You can help with such tasks as well.
UI/UX design: If you canâ€™t contribute with graphics, you can help with the UI/UX design.
You can also help spread the word, and share the project with the world to to improve its social presence.
